# Authentication

Relae’s official SDKs are coming soon.

You’ll be able to authenticate using standard API keys and integrate with Relae programmatically across all major languages.

## 🔧 SDKs Coming Soon

We are actively building first-class SDKs for:

- **JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js)**
- **Python**
- **Go**
- **Ruby**
- **PHP**

These SDKs will simplify:

- Retrying dead letter queue events
- Retrieving event logs
- Managing destinations
- Verifying signatures
